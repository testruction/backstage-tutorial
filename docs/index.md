## What is platform engineering

Platform engineering is a specialized field within the broader domain of software engineering and infrastructure management. It focuses on building and maintaining the foundational technologies and systems that enable the development, deployment, and scaling of applications and services within an organization. The primary goal of platform engineering is to create a stable, efficient, and secure environment for software development and operation.

Key aspects of platform engineering include:

1. **Infrastructure Management**: Platform engineers design and manage the underlying infrastructure, which can include servers, virtual machines, containers, and cloud resources. They ensure that this infrastructure is highly available and scalable to meet the demands of the applications running on it.
2. **Deployment and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Platform engineers build and maintain systems for automating the deployment of applications. They often implement CI/CD pipelines to enable developers to push code changes with ease, ensuring that new features and fixes can be delivered rapidly and reliably.
3. **Container Orchestration**: Technologies like Kubernetes are frequently used by platform engineers to manage and orchestrate containerized applications. This ensures that applications can run consistently across different environments and scale effectively.
4. **Service Discovery and Load Balancing**: Platform engineers implement systems for service discovery and load balancing to ensure that applications can find and communicate with each other efficiently. This is particularly important in microservices architectures.
5. **Monitoring and Logging**: They set up monitoring and logging systems to track the health and performance of applications and infrastructure. This helps in identifying issues and optimizing system performance.
6. **Security and Compliance**: Platform engineers play a critical role in ensuring the security and compliance of the platform and applications. They implement security measures, access controls, and regular audits to protect against vulnerabilities and data breaches.
7. **Resource Optimization**: Platform engineers strive to make the most efficient use of resources, whether it's optimizing server utilization, reducing costs in a cloud environment, or minimizing the carbon footprint.
8. **Documentation and Support**: They provide documentation and support to application developers, helping them understand how to use the platform effectively.

Platform engineering is essential in modern software development, especially in organizations that embrace DevOps practices. By creating a reliable and scalable platform for development and operations, platform engineers enable teams to focus on building and delivering software rather than dealing with infrastructure complexities. This, in turn, can lead to faster development cycles and more stable and resilient applications.
